## ðŸ“Œ APP Info 
The Morse Eye app is an innovative application that leverages AR technology to enable users to learn and experience Morse Code communication methods in a unique and attractive way. The app uses ARKit to track users' eyes and convert blinkers into Morse code, making them a communication method accessible to people with visual or hearing impairments. Inspired by the story of a prisoner of war using Morse code to deliver messages through blinkers, the creator of the app aimed to provide a fun and reciprocal way for people to learn and practice Morse code.

To this end, the app utilizes advanced AR recognition technology that tracks the user's face and detects eye movements. Sets a specific threshold to recognize when you close your eyes, and the program receives input by separating the user's blink by Morse code based on a specific period of time. This technology allows users to create and translate Morse Code messages simply by blinking through an AR camera.

In addition to AR technology, there are cards where you can practice Morse code by character, and pages where you can learn about Morse code simply. Overall, the Moss Eye app offers a fantastic platform for learning and practicing Moss Code with fun and ease.
